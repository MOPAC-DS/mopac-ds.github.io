# Our Work

At MOPAC, we use data science to drive innovation, transparency, and informed decision-making in public safety. On this page, youâ€™ll find a collection of our key initiatives, including learning resources for crime analysts, simplified explanations of our data science techniques, and open-source code from our projects. Through these efforts, we aim to empower others and foster collaboration to make London a safer city.
