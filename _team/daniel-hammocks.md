Completing a PhD in Applied Data Science on using NLP to identify new emerging methods of criminal perpetration.

My research, in collaboration with Greater Manchester Police, focuses on developing automated methods to identify new emerging methods of perpetration from free-text crime reports. I have also worked on various data science projects in the policing sector, using techniques such as computer vision, natural language processing, spatio-temporal analysis, and predictive modelling.
